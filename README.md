# Chatterbox

## About

A messaging application created with React, Firebase and Material UI.

Has a fully implemented authentication system with the ability to create new users and log in ones which already have credentials - validation checks are also in place.

Messaging system using Firebase Firestore to send and recieve messages, checking for real time updates with instant updates to the UI when a new message is recieved.

## Running the Application

To run this application, you need to download the project, cd into the chatterbox folder and then use the command:
`npm start`
This should start the application in your browser and everything should be fully functional.

## Extra Information

Some of the UI for the main messaging page is not the most creative in the world - this is due to the fact this application was designed more for understanding and using the Firebase API along with experimenting with more features of React. The CSS stylesheet would be improved upon if this was a production level application

If there are any bugs found, please report them to Michael Shepherd, the creator of this project.
